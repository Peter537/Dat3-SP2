This is where out documentation will go.

    Business model (which data did you decide to fetch - and for what?)
    Project management (how did you organize the team and work?)
    Webscraping (strategy and what you have implemented)
    DTOs (Which ones have you used and for what?)
    Persistence (JPA considerations and implementation)
    Test (strategy and implementation)
    DAO (implementation)
    Exceptionhandling (which errors can occur - and how do you handle them?)
    Use of parallel fetching (threads): How did you implement it?
    Functional programming: did you use any - and if so - how?
    Documentation: What did you find most important to document - and why?
