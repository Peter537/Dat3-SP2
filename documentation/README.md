This is where our documentation will go.

## Business model (which data did you decide to fetch - and for what?)
Data from SteamDB and the Steam API. Vores primær scraping er om players og player counts, vi vil gerne lave en DB hvor man nemt kan slå current player count, info om spillet samt recent nyheder.
    
## Project management (how did you organize the team and work?)
    
We work with Scrum and use Github Issues to create tasks. In a bigger project, we would have created a GitHub project instead.
    
## Webscraping (strategy and what you have implemented)
We tried using jsoup to scrape the website, but we ran into problems since the website we tried to scrape was under Cloudflare protection.
To circumvent this, we did a manual extraction of html files instead.
## DTOs (Which ones have you used and for what?)
## Persistence (JPA considerations and implementation)
## Test (strategy and implementation)
## DAO (implementation)
## Exception handling (which errors can occur - and how do you handle them?)
## Use of parallel fetching (threads): How did you implement it?
## Functional programming: did you use any - and if so - how?
## Documentation: What did you find most important to document - and why?
